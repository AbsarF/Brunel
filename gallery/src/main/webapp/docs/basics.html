<h3>Position Commands: <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></h3>
<p>
    The commands <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> set fields to be used for the x and y dimensions. These
    dimensions may be physically flipped by using the transpose option, but that does not affect how they behave.
    Elements <em>line</em>, <em>bar</em> and <em>area</em> go along the x axis, and are intended to show how the
    'y' field depends on the 'x' field. The Y field is considered as the "result" or "dependent" field and
    generally is thought of as the more important -- it's a rare chart that doesn't specify 'Y'.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">y(summer)</a>
</p>

<p>
    Diagram charts also use the position commands to specify how they are drawn; often they are defined as regular
    charts with the simple addition of a diagram keyword.
</p>

<h3>Basic Elements</h3>
<p>
    The language allows you to specify any of the following element types, which define the base way the data is
    displayed.
</p>
<pre>  point, bar, text,            line, area, path, polygon</pre>
<p>
    The most important thing to note about the element is whether it is an <b>aggregating</b> element. The first
    three elements (<em>point</em>, <em>bar</em> and <em>text</em>) are not, and they generate one symbol per row of
    data. The second group of four elements create a single graphic shape from
    all the data, and so some care is needed when applying <b>color</b>, <b>label</b> or other aesthetics as must ensure
    the value of that field is the same for the whole graphic shape. If the aesthetic field is a categorical one,
    then Brunel handles that for you automatically by splitting up the shape and making one graphic shape per group.
</p>
<p>
    if you do not specify an element, then the <code>point</code> element is the default. However a <b>diagram</b>
    knows which element it likes, and so will provide a suitable default. In general it is simplest not to define
    the element when using a diagram
