<H1>Maps</H1>

<p>
    Brunel maps provide geographic features that can be referenced by the name of the geography.  The geography to display is chosen automatically based on the
    requested content. <P>
    
    <code>map</code> can match a geographic location either to the values in a field or to specific geographic regions.  Specific
    geographic locations are supplied directly to the <code>map</code> action.  Geographic matches based on the contents of a field (like names of US states)
    are done by providing the field name containing the geographic names to <code>x</code>.  Labels that are specific to the chosen geography can be requested 
    using the <code>labels</code> parameter on <code>map</code>; whereas labels that are present in the data can use the <code>label</code> action with 
    the data field containing the labels.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map('usa', 'canada')</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map x(state) color(income)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map x(state) color(income) label(state)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map x(state) color(income) + map(labels)</a></p>


<H1>Networks</H1>
<p>
    Networks typically (but not always) require one data source for the nodes and a separate data source for the connections.  The nodes data should contain unique
    names for each node and the edges data should contain two fields that define which nodes are connected to each other.  An overlay (<code>+</code>) between
    an <code>edge</code> and a <code>network</code> is used to draw the nodes and edges.  The <code>key</code> action indicates the fields that are used across
    the <code>edge</code> and <code>network</code> defining the network visualization.<P>
    
    A network can be created from a single data source by indicating the connection fields in the <code>key</code> for the <code>edge</code>
    and <code>y</code> for the <code>network</code>.  The <code>#values</code> field is generated and contains the contents of the fields
    used to define the connections.<P>
    
    Additional overlays (<code>+</code>) can be provided using longitude and latitude values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">edge key(state, region) + network y(state, region) label(#values) legends(none)</a></p>
