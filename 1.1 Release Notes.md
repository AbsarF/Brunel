# 1.1 Release Notes

# Java version

Although informally true before, the official version of Java supported is Java 7.
Java 8 should also work fine, but primary testing will done on 1.7


# Minor Improvements
Axes on Smaller charts show fewer ticks, reducing overlapping.

Summmarization has been permitted for the x axis, so we can write `x(income) color(region) mean(income)` for example.

# Support for lists of items

If a field has string values separated by commas, these values will be autoconverted
into an internal list object. This will not change functionality significantly,
but it allows the use of a new summary operator `each(x)` which splits up the list
into multiple rows. As an example:

Raw data

        A   B
        0   a,b,c
        0   a,c
        1   a,c,b

Transformed by `each(B)`

        A   B
        0   a
        0   b
        0   c
        0   a
        0   c
        1   a
        1   c
        1   b

Transformed and summarized using the Brunel `x(B) y(#count) each(B)`

        B   #count
        a   3
        b   2
        c   3
